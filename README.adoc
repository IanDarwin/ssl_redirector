= ssl_redirector

General use case: you run a Java EE server and need to redirect from HTTP to HTTPS with the same site name.

== Usage

On JBoss Wildfly, change the hostname in jboss-web.xml.

On other servers, configure and install as needed.

== History

My specific use case: Interim support of running an old site on new server with haproxy
(using haproxy as an SSL-enabling reverse proxy).
Redirect just this one site from http to https (The App Server runs many sites, I can't redirect them all 
to SSL because many of them don't have anything that needs security and don't have SSL certs for), and, 
can't let the old Seam2 webapp itself do the redirect because
it's behind haproxy so will see the result as http, and redirect to ssl, 
and see the result as http...

Recursion: n, see Recursion.

== Bugs

There is probably a better way.
