= ssl_redirector
Interim support: running old ACB site on new server with haproxy
(using haproxy just as an SSL-enabling reverse proxy).
Redirect just this one site from http to https (can't redirect all yet, and, 
can't let the old Seam2 webapp itself do the redirect because
it's behind haproxy so will see the result as http, and redirect to ssl, 
and see the result as http...

Recursion: n, see Recursion.
